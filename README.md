# Customer-Conversion-Project
Developed a machine learning model for predicting customer conversion using a dataset. The process begins with data loading and exploration, where missing values and duplicates are handled. It employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the target variable's distribution and visualize relationships between categorical and numerical features. Outliers are identified and addressed to ensure accurate model performance. The categorical features are encoded, and the dataset is split into independent and dependent variables. Given the imbalanced nature of the target variable, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the classes. The features are then scaled, and three classification models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—are trained and evaluated. The results indicate that XGBoost achieves the highest accuracy and AUROC score, highlighting its effectiveness for this prediction task. Feature importance analysis shows that the duration of contact is the most significant predictor of customer conversion, suggesting its critical role in optimizing marketing strategies. Overall, the model demonstrates a robust approach to customer conversion prediction, with XGBoost recommended for deployment due to its superior performance.
